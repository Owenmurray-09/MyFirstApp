# Job Marketplace App - Development Plan

## Current Status
This is a well-architected React Native job marketplace app connecting students with employers. The app has solid foundations with:
- **React Native + Expo Router** for cross-platform development
- **Supabase** backend integration (currently using mock data)
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Role-based routing** (student/employer flows)
- **Real-time messaging** architecture
- **Comprehensive UI component system**

## üéØ Immediate Priorities (Week 1-2)

### 1. Backend Infrastructure Setup
- **Set up real Supabase project** (currently using placeholders)
- **Configure environment variables** with actual Supabase URLs/keys
- **Run database migrations** to create the schema
- **Set up Supabase Storage bucket** for job images
- **Configure Row Level Security policies**

### 2. Authentication System
- **Replace mock authentication** with real Supabase Auth
- **Test sign-up/sign-in flows**
- **Implement onboarding flow** for role selection
- **Add password recovery functionality**

### 3. Core Data Flow
- **Create seed data** for testing (companies, jobs, users)
- **Test job creation and browsing**
- **Verify role-based access controls**
- **Connect real-time messaging features**

## üöÄ Medium-term Development (Week 3-4)

### 4. Feature Completion
- **Job application workflow** (student applies, employer reviews)
- **Image upload functionality** for job postings
- **Calendar/events system** for interviews
- **Push notifications** via Supabase Edge Functions
- **Search and filtering improvements**

### 5. User Experience Polish
- **Error handling and loading states**
- **Form validation improvements**
- **Responsive design refinements**
- **Performance optimizations**

## üîß How to Work Together Effectively

### Collaborative Development Approach:

1. **Feature-by-Feature Development**
   - Pick one feature at a time
   - I'll help implement, test, and debug
   - You provide feedback and requirements

2. **Iterative Testing**
   - Set up feature ‚Üí Test together ‚Üí Refine ‚Üí Move to next
   - Use the local dev server for immediate feedback
   - I can simulate different user scenarios

3. **Problem-Solving Partnership**
   - You identify issues or desired changes
   - I'll analyze and propose solutions
   - We can brainstorm features and improvements together

### Suggested Workflow:
- **Start sessions** with "Let's work on [specific feature]"
- **I'll create todo lists** to track progress transparently
- **Regular testing** - we'll run the app frequently to verify changes
- **Documentation updates** as we build new features

## üìä Technical Recommendations

### Code Quality & Development:
- Add comprehensive error boundaries
- Implement proper TypeScript strict mode
- Set up automated testing (Jest/Detox)
- Add code linting and formatting
- Create deployment pipeline

### Production Readiness:
- Environment-specific configurations
- Performance monitoring
- Security audit of RLS policies
- App store deployment preparation
- User analytics integration

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Analysis

### Project Structure:
- **File-based routing** with Expo Router
- **Role-based layouts** with auth guards
- **Custom hooks** for data management
- **Reusable UI components** with theme system
- **Mock authentication** (needs replacement)

### Database Schema (Supabase):
- **Profiles** - User info with student/employer roles
- **Companies** - Employer organizations
- **Jobs** - Job postings with tags, location, images
- **Applications** - Student job applications
- **Threads/Messages** - Real-time messaging
- **Comments** - Public job reviews
- **Events** - Calendar functionality
- **Recommendations** - Employer references

### Key Files to Focus On:
- `lib/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Replace mock auth with real implementation
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Update with real Supabase credentials
- `supabase/schema.sql` - Database structure ready for deployment
- `app/_layout.tsx` & route layouts - Authentication flow

## üìã Phase-by-Phase Development Plan

### Phase 1: Backend & Authentication (Priority)
1. **Set up real Supabase project** - Replace placeholder URLs with actual backend
2. **Configure environment variables** - Set up .env with real credentials
3. **Database setup** - Run schema migrations and configure RLS policies
4. **Replace mock authentication** - Implement real sign-up/sign-in flows
5. **Create seed data** - Add sample companies, jobs, and users for testing

### Phase 2: Core Features
1. **Job management workflow** - Complete create/edit/browse functionality
2. **Application system** - Student applies, employer reviews process
3. **Real-time messaging** - Connect Supabase realtime for live chat
4. **Image upload** - Set up Supabase Storage for job photos
5. **Calendar integration** - Events and interview scheduling

### Phase 3: Polish & Production
1. **Error handling** - Improve user feedback and edge cases
2. **Performance optimization** - Loading states and caching
3. **Testing** - User flows and edge cases
4. **Deployment** - App store preparation and CI/CD

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

**Start Here:** Set up a real Supabase project and replace the mock authentication system. This will unlock all the other features and allow for proper testing of the full application flow.

**Collaborative Approach:** Work feature-by-feature with regular testing and iteration. I can help implement, debug, and test each component as we build out the full functionality.

The foundation is excellent - now it's time to connect it to a real backend and bring all the features to life!
